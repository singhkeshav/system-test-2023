# Project Title
This is a System Test in which the user can enter his Grocery Name, Quantity, Grocery Type, and Grocery Image, as well as view a list of grocery goods.

# Project Tech Stack
   1. Node js and Express Framwork : 
        a. get grocery list : Make a get method to retrieve all grocery products.
        b. add the new grocery items: establish a store publish method or add additional groceries to the store
  2.  React js Libary :  
          Using bootstrap and react, simply display the grocery item and use the get and add API like the rest.

# Project prerequisites 
  1. Local Node Env must be required. 
  2. Webpack version and CLI must be necessary because I constructed this system test from scratch using webpack and node js, without utilizing any bolerploit.
  3. NPM must be required on local

# Project Run Steps
  1. npm install 
  2. npm run dev (I used the concurrently(npm package) package to run a node (server process) and a client (React process) in parallel. with single commands)
  3. or we can start both the server and the backend independently. i.e
     a. for backend :- npm run start
     b. for UI      :- npm run serve
     c. single command : npm run dev
